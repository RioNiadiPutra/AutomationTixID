# Hello, Welcome to my TixID Automation Script Testing Portofolio

In this automation testing, I used Katalon Studio Framework Automation and created several test scripts for modules such as account registration, login, movie search by category, and buying ticket E2E. Some of the scripts include both negative and positive testing. I have also attached the test cases I have created, you can check it out:

I also did a demo of my automation testing on YouTube, and here is the link:

I really appreciate any feedback or suggestions regarding my automation testing, whether it's related to the scripts or the test cases.

#### Thank You !
